Welcome to NAP's documentation!
===============================

NAP (New Analysis Pipeline) is a plotting extension of Yesselman and Rouskin's DREEM module. 

NAP merges the MutationHistogram class of DREEM and a csv file from a RNA structure prediction as a dataset.
The data is stored online using Google Firebase.
NAP provides plots and data selection functions to analyse this dataset.

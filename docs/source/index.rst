Welcome to NAP's documentation!
===============================

NAP (New Analysis Pipeline) is a plotting extension of Prof. Joe Yesselman's
DREEM module. 

NAP merges the MutationHistogram class of DREEM and a csv 
file from a RNA structure prediction, into a dataset stored on Google's Firebase.
NAP provides plots and data\_selection functions to visualize DREEM's output.
